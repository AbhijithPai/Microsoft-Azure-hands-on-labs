# Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) – Compute & Networking Basics

This repository documents my learning from **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)**, specifically **Domain 2: Describe Azure Compute and Networking Services**.

The goal of this repo is to demonstrate conceptual understanding of Azure core services and cloud architecture fundamentals.

### 🔹 Virtual Machine Fundamentals
- Resources required to create a VM:
  - Subscription
  - Resource Group
  - Virtual Network & Subnet
  - Network Interface
  - Public / Private IP
  - Storage (OS Disk, Data Disk)
- VM availability options:
  - Availability Sets
  - Availability Zones

---

### 🔹 Application Hosting Options
