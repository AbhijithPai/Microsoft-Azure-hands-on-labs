# December 19 – Azure Identity, Access, and Security Concepts

This README documents the Azure concepts I studied on **December 19**, as part of my preparation for the **Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)** certification.

The focus of this session was on **identity management, authentication, authorization, and cloud security principles** in Azure.

---

## 📌 Concepts Covered

### 🔹 Directory Services in Azure
- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**
  - Cloud-based identity and access management service
  - Manages users, groups, and application access
- Integration with Microsoft services and third-party applications

---

### 🔹 Authentication Methods in Azure
- **Password-based authentication**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**
- Certificate-based and token-based authentication (high-level)

---

### 🔹 Azure AD Conditional Access
- Policy-based access control
- Access decisions based on:
  - User or group
  - Device state
  - Location
  - Risk level
- Used to enforce MFA and secure access dynamically

---

### 🔹 Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Authorization system for managing access to Azure resources
- Role assignments consist of:
  - Security principal
  - Role definition
  - Scope
- Common roles:
  - Owner
  - Contributor
  - Reader

---

### 🔹 Zero Trust & Defense in Depth
- **Zero Trust**
  - Never trust, always verify
  - Assume breach mindset
- **Defense in Depth**
  - Multiple layers of security controls
  - Reduces impact of potential attacks

---

### 🔹 Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Cloud-native security posture management service
- Provides:
  - Security recommendations
  - Threat protection
  - Compliance monitoring
- Helps identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities

---

### 🔹 Thought Experiment: Simple to Complex Security
- Importance of combining multiple security controls
- Balancing usability, cost, and security requirements
- Understanding real-world cloud security trade-offs

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

After this session, I can:
- Explain identity and access management in Azure
- Differentiate authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Understand conditional access and RBAC concepts
- Describe core cloud security principles
- Recognize Azure-native security tools

---
